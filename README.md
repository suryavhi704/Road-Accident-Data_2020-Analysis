# 📘 Project Overview

This project analyzes road accident data across million-plus cities in India to uncover patterns, major causes, and outcomes of accidents. Using Python-based data analytics, the goal was to identify key risk factors and visualize accident trends for better decision-making and prevention strategies.

# 🎯 Objective

To analyze the causes of road accidents in Indian cities.

To identify cities with the highest number of accidents.

To explore relationships between causes and accident outcomes.

To visualize trends and provide actionable insights for road safety.

# 🧠 Process Workflow

Data Preprocessing – Cleaned and formatted raw dataset for consistency.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Performed univariate and multivariate analysis.

Visualization – Created insightful plots using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

Business Question Solving – Derived insights and summarized key findings.

# 🧩 Key Insights

1.Top 5 cities with highest accidents: Chennai, Delhi, Jabalpur, Bengaluru, Indore.

2.Major contributing causes: Impacting Vehicle/Object, Road Features, and Traffic Control.

3.Severity correlation:

Minor injuries: 29,983 cases (mostly due to road features & weather).

Grievous injuries: 20,532 cases (linked with vehicle impact and violations).

Fatalities: 13,542 deaths (commonly associated with traffic violations and poor control).

# 📊 Tools & Libraries

Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Jupyter Notebook
